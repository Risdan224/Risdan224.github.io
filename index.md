### Predicting Saudi Used Car Prices using Machine Learning (Regression Model)

Sellers and buyers of used cars who do not have sufficient knowledge about cars will find it difficult to determine the price of the car to be sold. This can lead to unsold cars or losses for the seller, for the buyer the loss is the difficulty of deciding to buy a used car. This project is to create a model to predict the price of a used car based on the specifications of the car. The price generated by this model will be a reference for car sellers and buyers when buying and selling used cars. The goal is for used car sellers/buyers to make quicker decisions in conducting transactions (selling/buying).
